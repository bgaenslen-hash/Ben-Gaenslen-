Check out the projects that I have worked on!
Bucks Hackathon: Analyze Bucks consumer data to identify trends in ticket sales, identify causes of fan regression or progression, and create a marketing approach taylored to specific fans.
CPOE Analysis: This report dives into the receiving side of completion percentage, using a tree-based modeling approach, to identify variables that predict receiver success, and summarize/visualize findings. Co-authored Ty Curtis, Brianna O'Malley, and Cooper Wisener! NflfastR data set: https://nflfastr.com/. 
CDE Analysis: Using the Colorado Department of Education API (https://ed.cde.state.co.us/datapipeline), I used bootstrap resampling to determine if curriculum changes fostered a positive change in Colorado student test scores
